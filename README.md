### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Frank, and I have been doing software for 23 years. I mainly do web apps. In 2017, 
I founded CGWire, a company aiming at improving collaboration in animation studios.
For that, we develop Kitsu, a production management platform.

A few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m improving Kitsu and looking for new studio leads.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spanish. It's a widely used language, so it would help to understand it.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with video streaming.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software development or entrepreneurship.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me an email frank@cg-wire.com!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play the clarinet, and my favorite music is from Studio Ghibli.
