### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Frank and I do software since 23 years. I mainly do web apps. In 2017, 
I founded CGWire, a company aiming at improving collaboration in animation studios.
For that we delevop Kitsu, a production management platform.

A few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving the Kitsu frontend and finding talents to help me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spanish, it's a widely used language so it would help to understand it.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with video streaming
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software development or entrepreneurship
